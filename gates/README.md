#Basic gates and small size composites which can be used further for formation of RAMs, CPUs etc

1. We will be using Nand gates, as it is considered primitive gate, and will be forming other basic gates using Nand gate.
2. Nand gates can be used off-the-shelf, obviously we will not go one level down, it's literally physics now! - For more info on how a primitive logic gateis formed I would recommend this youtube video which explains about the working of transistors in a beutiful way.
3. Other gates created in this module are and, or, xor, not, Mux, Dmux, Not16, And16, Or16, Mux16, Or8Way, Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16, DMux4Way, Dmux8Way
